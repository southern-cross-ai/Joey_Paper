# 6.4 Emphasis on Reproducibility and Edge Readiness

Given our focus on public interest applications particularly in education, healthcare, and legal services reproducibility and edge-readiness are non-negotiable.
Our models must be:
Reproducible, with version-controlled training scripts, open datasets, and fully documented experiments
Portable, with support for Docker-based inference environments, ONNX exports, and quantized model variants
Deployable, in secure or disconnected environments such as schools, local councils, or rural health clinics
We’ve begun building internal tooling (under the “ModelWorks” framework) that ensures all stages of the JoeyLLM pipeline from preprocessing to evaluation can be run with minimal dependencies and full traceability. Our long-term vision is to support small and mid-scale deployments, where sovereignty isn’t just about model weights, but about control over how and where a model is used.
