# 8.1 Southern Cross AIâ€™s Open-Source Structure

Southern Cross AI was founded not just as a technical project, but as a civic infrastructure experiment a space where researchers, developers, public servants, and everyday citizens could work together on a sovereign AI project. 

From the beginning, the initiative was organized around open-source principles: transparent repositories, open documentation, public Discord discussions, and an open-door contribution model.

Rather than operating under a closed research lab or a single institutional owner, the community grew through shared goals: build something useful, Australian, and open. This model attracted contributors across academic institutions (particularly ANU), hobbyist AI builders, open-source veterans, students, and long-time developers. Early traction came not from formal recruitment but from shared purpose.
