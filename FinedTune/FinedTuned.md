## Fine-Tuning vs. Culturally Grounded Models for LLM Alignment
## Limited Cultural Nuance Capture: 
Fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM on a culture-specific corpus often fails to fully capture the linguistic nuance, tone, and context of that culture. Studies find that even carefully curated local corpora may not reflect a culture’s core characteristics or its unique subtleties, limiting the model’s cultural precision

## Practical and Data Constraints: 
Aligning a large model to a new cultural context via fine-tuning is resource-intensive and feasible only for well-resourced groups. It requires massive relevant data and computational effort, as seen in efforts like Sweden’s and Japan’s development of their own GPT variants to address local language and cultural nuances
researchgate.net Even then, fine-tuning provides a post hoc adjustment that might not deeply ingrain the desired cultural worldview into the model’s internal representations.
## Culturally Grounded Foundation Models
A Viable Solution: Instead of retrofitting a generic model, an emerging view is to train foundation models with cultural grounding from the outset. By pre-training on data rich in the target culture’s language, idioms, and worldview, the model can inherently learn that culture’s nuances. Research suggests that a model pre-trained with a higher proportion of data from a given culture will align more closely with that culture’s norms and values than one adapted via later fine-tuning
