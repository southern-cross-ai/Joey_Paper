# 2.2 Data Collection Efforts

With that goal in mind, we focused initially on curating high-quality Australian datasets. This effort went far beyond scraping headlines or pulling PDFs. Instead, we organised data around a mix of formal, institutional, conversational, and regional content types. Key sources included:

- **Project Gutenberg Australia,** chunked into different token lengths to test formatting and memory efficiency
- **Wiki-Australia, AWR, and Hansard**-style content to reflect governmental and academic language
- **ICE-AUS, COOEE, CoANZSE, and ACE,** which provided Australian spoken English in formal and informal contexts
- **Reddit, YouTube comments, and Twitter** corpora to capture everyday phrasing, slang, and informal discourse
- **Australian Radio Talkback Corpus (ART),** offering real-world audio transcripts
- **FineWeb and Common Crawl subsets,** filtered to include only .au domains or Australia-relevant topics

This data was largely gathered and prepared through open collaboration. Students, hobbyists, and volunteers from our Discord community helped source, clean, tag, and structure the data, often working across time zones and institutions. The shared goal of creating something truly Australian brought together contributors from ANU, the open-source community, and experienced developers from the AI field. Even at this early stage, community participation was central to our progress.
