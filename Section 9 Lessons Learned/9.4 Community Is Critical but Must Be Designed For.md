# 9.4 Community Is Critical but Must Be Designed For

Open-source collaboration is powerful, but it doesn't self-organize at scale. What worked in the early days fluid roles, informal sprints, and chat-based planning eventually hit limits. We learned that collaborative execution needs structure: roles, rituals, versioning, scope boundaries, and feedback loops. Importantly, we also saw that the right scaffolding didnâ€™t reduce engagement it enhanced it. When contributors knew how to plug in and why their work mattered, they showed up with purpose.
