# 9.1 Data Alone Isn’t Enough

One of the earliest realizations was that local data, no matter how well-curated, cannot compensate for architectural and scale limitations. While culturally aligned datasets are essential for downstream tuning and evaluation, they don’t fix the deeper assumptions baked into a model’s design. Our experiments with BabyJoey and Mistral fine-tunes showed that even models trained on Australian content continued to behave in ways shaped by their original structure and upstream data bias. Cultural alignment cannot be patched in it must be designed for.
