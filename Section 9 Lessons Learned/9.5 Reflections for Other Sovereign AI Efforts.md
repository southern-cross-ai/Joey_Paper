# 9.5 Reflections for Other Sovereign AI Efforts

For other communities, countries, or institutions considering their own sovereign AI path, our experience suggests a few guidelines:

* Start small but with ownership. Even a 64M parameter model can teach you more than a dozen fine-tunes.

* Build openly but architect intentionally. Transparency only works when it’s matched by clear goals and reproducibility.

* Engage early even if imperfectly. Community trust and collaboration don’t emerge fully formed; they evolve through action and iteration.

* Accept friction. Disagreement, divergence, and technical missteps are part of the process. What matters is how they're handled.

* Think beyond models. AI sovereignty includes storage, deployment, governance, and cultural resonance not just training loops.
