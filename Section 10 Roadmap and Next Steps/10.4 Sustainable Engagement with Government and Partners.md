# 10.4 Sustainable Engagement with Government and Partners

While early interest came mostly from academia and the open-source community, the next stage of JoeyLLMâ€™s development involves building durable relationships with government, industry, and institutional partners. Our goal is not to hand over a finished model, but to co-develop use cases, deployment pathways, and governance models in collaboration with those who will use and regulate these systems.

This includes:

* Briefings and pilot discussions with public sector agencies

* Engagement with national infrastructure providers (e.g. AWS, NCI, and research networks)

* Open frameworks for fine-tuning and adaptation by state and regional bodies

* Licensing models that support public use without enabling misuse or misrepresentation

The JoeyLLM initiative is not envisioned as a vendor - it is a civic capability builder.
