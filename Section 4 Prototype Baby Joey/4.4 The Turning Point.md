# 4.4 The Turning Point

More than anything, BabyJoey proved that fine-tuning alone was not the answer. Even with carefully curated data, the architectural and scale limitations of small models couldnâ€™t be ignored. The experience validated our decision to go deeper: to understand transformer architecture from the ground up, and to build the capacity both technical and organizational to train larger, more useful models.

That realization marked the transition from BabyJoey to JoeyLLM a multi-phase effort aimed at creating an Australian foundational model capable of real alignment, scalability, and deployment in public-interest contexts.
