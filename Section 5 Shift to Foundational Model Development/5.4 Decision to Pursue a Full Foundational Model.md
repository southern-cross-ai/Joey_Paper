# 5.4 Decision to Pursue a Full Foundational Model

These limitations, taken together, led to a decisive pivot: we would build JoeyLLM from the ground up as an Australian foundational model not just a fine-tune of someone elseâ€™s.
This shift was not just technical it was strategic. A foundational model would give us:
Architectural control, enabling us to experiment with scaling, routing, and efficient training
Deployment flexibility, allowing us to target use in constrained public environments
Cultural and civic alignment, grounded in local data, norms, and needs
Governance transparency, so that the full training and tuning process could be audited, adapted, and improved by the community
It also set a higher bar for sustainability. Foundational models are harder to build but they offer long-term sovereignty and adaptability. They become infrastructure, not just tools.
With that shift, the JoeyLLM project took on new urgency and scope. We were no longer just trying to localize a model we were trying to build national capability.
