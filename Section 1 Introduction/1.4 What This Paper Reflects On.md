# 1.4 What This Paper Reflects On

This paper is not a technical blueprint or a product showcase. Instead, it’s a documentation of what was learned technically, organizationally, and socially in the process of building Australia’s first open-source foundational model. We reflect on:

- Why fine-tuning alone proved insufficient
- The infrastructure and architectural challenges of scaling
- The early lessons from building BabyJoey
- The complexities of coordinating a distributed, volunteer-based team, including university contributors
- The rationale for developing JoeyLLM as a foundational model
- What lies ahead as the model scales toward national relevance

Through these reflections, we aim to contribute to a growing global conversation about sovereign AI not as a talking point, but as a lived technical and civic practice.
