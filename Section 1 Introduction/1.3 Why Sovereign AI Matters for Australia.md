# 1.3 Why Sovereign AI Matters for Australia

Large language models are no longer experimental they are becoming embedded in public services, policy delivery, education, legal assistance, and communication. Most of these models are developed overseas, governed by commercial terms, and shaped by cultural and political norms that don’t necessarily reflect Australian values, legal frameworks, or regional needs.

For a country like Australia, which relies heavily on imported digital infrastructure, the risks of dependency are real. If access to foreign AI models is throttled, restricted, or misaligned with national priorities, entire public systems could be affected. Sovereign AI is not about isolation, it’s about resilience. It means having the capacity to audit, adapt, and deploy models within local infrastructure, guided by local governance.
