# 1.1 Purpose of This Paper

This paper presents a reflective account of Southern Cross AIâ€™s first year developing JoeyLLM, an open-source foundational language model designed specifically for Australia. Rather than showcasing a completed product, it documents the transition from an initially modest goal of fine-tuning an existing model to the more ambitious and technically complex effort of building a sovereign AI system from the ground up. 

We share lessons from that transition, discuss the challenges encountered, and offer insights that may help others working on similar national-scale AI projects. Each AI project takes its own path from concept through to execution, and this paper will attempt to guide you through our specific journey - what went right, what went wrong and unexpected opportunities that presented themselves along the way.
