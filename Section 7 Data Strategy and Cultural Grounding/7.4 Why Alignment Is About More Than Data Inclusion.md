# 7.4 Why Alignment Is About More Than Data Inclusion

One of the most important lessons we’ve learned is that alignment cannot be solved through data alone. Including Australian data even in large volumes does not guarantee a model that behaves appropriately, understands local norms, or communicates effectively in civic contexts.

Alignment also depends on:

* Model architecture and training scale, which affect generalization and tone

* Instruction tuning strategies, which shape how the model interprets prompts and interacts with users

* Governance structures, which determine who decides what the model should do and not do

* Evaluation processes, including red-teaming, community testing, and public sector feedback

In short, cultural alignment is not a dataset it’s a process, one that spans model design, training, fine-tuning, evaluation, and long-term deployment.
