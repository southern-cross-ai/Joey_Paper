# 7.2 Challenges of Quantity and Quality

Despite the breadth of content, two consistent challenges emerged: data quantity and data quality.

In terms of quantity, Australian web and literature content is simply limited compared to global-scale datasets used in commercial LLMs. The total volume of publicly usable, copyright-safe Australian content remains small by comparison even with heavy scraping and filtering. Much of what exists is domain-specific, fragmented, or dated.

In terms of quality, many texts especially in the public domain carry stylistic, cultural, or linguistic quirks that skew the model's tone and generalization. Early experiments with BabyJoey revealed that a model trained solely on older literature would adopt an archaic, overly formal voice. Modernity, diversity, and inclusivity require more than quantity they require representative sampling from voices that are current, grounded, and broad-based.

We also encountered technical challenges: formatting inconsistencies, metadata loss, data duplication, and the need for ethical filtering to avoid inappropriate or biased material. Each dataset required hand-tuning and often community review before it was integrated into training pipelines.
