# 7.1 Curation of Australian Data Sources

From the beginning, Southern Cross AI took a deliberate, bottom-up approach to data collection. Rather than scraping indiscriminately from the internet, we focused on curating high-quality, Australian-specific datasets that reflect the nation’s linguistic, institutional, and cultural landscape.
Key sources included:
Project Gutenberg Australia, including Australian authors, processed into chunked formats for different context lengths
Government publications, including open-access reports, parliamentary records, policy briefs, and legislation
Australian academic corpora, such as ICE-AUS, COOEE, ACE, and CoANZSE, which reflect formal and informal regional English
Social and conversational datasets, including filtered Reddit and Twitter posts, YouTube comments, and talkback radio transcripts
Specialist domains, such as the Australian Women's Register, health documents, and education materials aligned with the national curriculum
Web-scale datasets, like Hugging Face’s FineWeb and Common Crawl, filtered specifically to .au domains and regionally relevant sites
This corpus reflects a wide cross-section of Australian life from formal parliamentary language to everyday online discourse.
