# 7.3 Handling Indigenous Data and Ethical Governance

One of the most sensitive areas in our data strategy is the treatment of Indigenous language, knowledge, and cultural materials.
Southern Cross AI takes a firm stance: no Indigenous data is included in any training corpus without explicit permission and community-defined terms of use. We treat Indigenous data as governed by its own sovereignty not as a subset of “Australian data” to be included by default.
This means that:
Any content involving First Nations voices must be reviewed by relevant cultural custodians
Usage must be aligned with community goals such as language preservation, health equity, or cultural education not generic training performance
Protocols for consent, attribution, and ongoing governance are respected
In some cases, we’ve engaged with Indigenous advisors and researchers to explore co-creation of data resources. In other cases, we’ve deliberately chosen not to include potentially sensitive materials, recognizing that absence is sometimes more ethical than inclusion without trust.
